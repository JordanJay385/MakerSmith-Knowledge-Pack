# Volume 4 – CAD & STL Creation

This volume covers the process of designing, repairing, and preparing STL files for 3D printing. It focuses on practical workflows using **Fusion 360**, **FreeCAD**, **Tinkercad**, and **Blender**, with attention to tolerances, parametric design, and mesh repair.

## 1. CAD Platforms Overview

### 1.1 Fusion 360
- **Strengths:** Professional parametric modeling, assemblies, CAM integration.
- **Workflow:** Sketch → Extrude/Revolve → Combine/Fillet/Chamfer → Export STL.
- **Tip:** Name sketches and bodies to keep large projects organized.

### 1.2 FreeCAD
- **Strengths:** Open-source parametric CAD, customizable workbenches.
- **Workflow:** Part Design workbench for parametric parts; Mesh Design for STL prep.

### 1.3 Tinkercad
- **Strengths:** Beginner-friendly, browser-based, quick concept models.
- **Workflow:** Combine shapes → adjust dimensions → export STL.

### 1.4 Blender
- **Strengths:** Mesh editing, sculpting, complex organic shapes.
- **Workflow:** Import mesh → edit geometry → fix normals → export STL.

## 2. Design Principles for 3D Printing

- **Parametric design:** Set dimensions as parameters to easily adjust later.
- **Overhang limits:** Avoid overhangs >45° unless using supports.
- **Wall thickness:** Minimum 1.2 mm for strength (3 perimeters with 0.4 mm nozzle).
- **Tolerances:** For press fits, leave 0.1–0.2 mm gap; for sliding fits, 0.3–0.5 mm.
- **Fillets vs chamfers:** Fillets for stress distribution; chamfers for easy assembly.

## 3. Preparing for 3D Printing

### 3.1 STL Export Settings
- **Binary STL** – smaller file size, widely supported.
- **ASCII STL** – larger, human-readable, useful for debugging.

**Fusion 360 Export:** Right-click body → Save as STL → High refinement.

### 3.2 Checking for Non-Manifold Edges
- Non-manifold geometry = holes, flipped normals, disconnected edges.
- Repair before slicing to avoid unpredictable prints.

### 3.3 Fixing Inverted Normals
- In Blender: Edit Mode → Select All → Recalculate Normals (Shift+N).

---

## 4. Mesh Optimization

- **Decimation:** Reduce triangle count to make slicing faster without losing detail.
- **Remeshing:** Create evenly sized triangles for cleaner slicing.

**Tools:**
- Meshmixer → Edit → Reduce
- Blender → Decimate modifier

## 5. Troubleshooting STL Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Holes in mesh | Export errors or bad boolean ops | Use Meshmixer or Netfabb repair |
| Self-intersecting faces | Overlapping geometry | Merge or clean up in CAD before export |
| Scaling wrong | Units mismatch | Confirm units before export; Fusion 360 defaults to mm |

---

## 6. Designing for Electronics Integration

- **PCB mounting holes:** Match manufacturer hole sizes; add 0.2 mm clearance.
- **Cable channels:** Include 10–20% extra space for sleeving.
- **Snap-fit features:** Use flexible materials (PLA+ or PETG) and correct clearance.

## 7. Example Workflows

### 7.1 Fusion 360 → Cura → Ender 3
1. Model part with correct tolerances.
2. Export STL (high refinement).
3. Import into Cura; set orientation and supports.
4. Slice and save G-code to SD card.

### 7.2 FreeCAD → PrusaSlicer → Prusa Mini
1. Design in Part Design workbench.
2. Export as STL via Mesh Design.
3. Slice in PrusaSlicer; check preview.
4. Print via USB or SD.

---

## 8. Quick Reference

- Always check model scale before slicing.
- Use parametric design for adjustable parts.
- Avoid overly complex meshes; keep STL file size reasonable.
- Test-print critical parts at reduced height to check fit.
