# Volume 5 – CNC & Digital Fabrication Master Guide

This volume covers CNC routing, milling, plasma cutting, and laser engraving as part of the maker toolkit. It includes machine setup, tooling selection, CAM workflows, feeds/speeds, and safety.

## 1. CNC Basics

### 1.1 Machine Types
- **CNC Router** – Ideal for wood, plastics, light aluminum.
- **CNC Mill** – Precision machining, metals, smaller work area.
- **Plasma Cutter** – Fast cutting of conductive metals.
- **Laser Cutter/Engraver** – High precision, for wood, acrylic, engraving metals (with coatings).

### 1.2 Key Components
- Spindle/laser head/plasma torch.
- Stepper or servo motors with motion control.
- Controller board (GRBL, Mach3, LinuxCNC).
- Workholding (clamps, vacuum tables, vises).

## 2. CAM Workflows

### 2.1 Fusion 360 CAM
1. Model the part.
2. Switch to Manufacture workspace.
3. Set stock size and origin.
4. Select operation type (2D contour, pocket, adaptive clearing).
5. Generate toolpaths, simulate, post-process.

### 2.2 LightBurn (Laser)
- Import vector art (SVG, DXF) or raster images.
- Assign layers with speed/power settings.
- Frame work area before cutting.

### 2.3 SheetCAM (Plasma)
- Import DXF.
- Define tool parameters (kerf width, pierce delay).
- Nest parts for material efficiency.

## 3. Tooling & Feeds/Speeds

### 3.1 Tool Types
- **End mills**: Flat, ball nose, V-bit.
- **Laser lenses**: Focus distance determines kerf width.
- **Plasma tips**: Sized for amperage.

### 3.2 Feeds & Speeds Formula
`Feed rate = RPM × Chip Load × Number of Flutes`

### 3.3 Starter Reference Table (Router, 1/8" end mill)
| Material | RPM | Feed Rate | Depth per Pass |
|----------|-----|-----------|----------------|
| Plywood  | 18k | 900 mm/min | 2–3 mm |
| Acrylic  | 16k | 600 mm/min | 1–2 mm |
| Aluminum | 12k | 300 mm/min | 0.5–1 mm |

## 4. Workholding & Fixturing
- **Clamps**: Simple, strong, can interfere with toolpath.
- **Vacuum table**: Great for flat sheet material.
- **Double-sided tape**: Good for small/light parts.
- **Vise**: Best for rigid holding in milling.

## 5. Material Strategies

### 5.1 Wood
- Upcut bits for clean bottom edge, downcut for clean top edge.
- Avoid burning: keep feed rate high enough.

### 5.2 Aluminum
- Use single-flute bits for chip clearance.
- Apply lubricant (WD-40, cutting fluid).

### 5.3 Acrylic
- Use O-flute bits.
- Avoid melting: high feed, moderate RPM, shallow passes.

### 5.4 Steel (Plasma)
- Proper pierce height is critical.
- Adjust amperage for thickness.

## 6. G-code for CNC vs 3D Printing
- CNC uses absolute positioning with multiple tool changes.
- 3D printing G-code includes extrusion commands (E axis); CNC omits.
- Common commands: `G0` (rapid), `G1` (linear cut), `M3` (spindle on), `M5` (spindle off).

---

## 7. Maintenance & Calibration
- Check tram (spindle perpendicularity) monthly.
- Clean and lubricate lead screws/rails.
- Inspect belts or ball screws for wear.

---

## 8. Safety Essentials
- Always wear eye and ear protection.
- Secure loose clothing and hair.
- Stay clear of moving gantry and spindle.
- Never leave machine unattended.

---

## 9. Example Projects
1. CNC router: Custom plywood laptop stand.
2. Laser cutter: Acrylic LED sign with engraved logo.
3. Plasma: Steel garden art panel.
