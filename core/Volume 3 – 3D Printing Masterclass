# Volume 3 – 3D Printing Masterclass

This volume provides a deep dive into 3D printing with a focus on **Ender 3**, **Cura**, advanced slicer strategies, filament-specific profiles, troubleshooting, calibration, and STL preparation workflows.

## 1. Hardware Overview

### 1.1 Ender 3 Variants
- **Ender 3 (Original)** – Budget-friendly, requires manual bed leveling, stock hotend PTFE-lined.
- **Ender 3 V2** – Glass bed, quieter stepper drivers, better screen.
- **Ender 3 S1/S1 Pro** – Direct drive extruder, auto bed leveling (CR Touch), dual Z-axis.

### 1.2 Common Upgrades
- **All-metal hotend** – Allows higher temp filaments (PETG, Nylon, PC).
- **Dual Z-axis kit** – Improves gantry stability.
- **BLTouch/CR Touch** – Automatic mesh bed leveling.
- **OctoPrint** – Remote monitoring & control.
- **Enclosure** – Essential for ABS, ASA, Nylon.

## 2. Slicer Mastery

### 2.1 Cura Advanced Settings
- **Flow rate**: Fine-tune extrusion; start at 100%, adjust in 1% increments.
- **Coasting**: Reduce oozing by stopping extrusion slightly before travel.
- **Ironing**: Smooth top surfaces by slow extra passes.
- **Z-hop**: Prevent nozzle collisions when traveling.

### 2.2 Support Strategies
- **Tree supports**: Flexible, save material, easy removal; best for organic shapes.
- **Block supports**: Stronger, better for mechanical parts.

### 2.3 PrusaSlicer Equivalents
- **Flow rate** = Extrusion multiplier.
- **Coasting** = Wipe while retracting.
- **Ironing** = Enable ironing in top solid infill.

## 3. Filament Profiles

| Material | Nozzle Temp | Bed Temp | Cooling | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|-------|
| PLA      | 190–210°C   | 60°C     | 100%    | Easy to print |
| PLA+     | 205–215°C   | 60°C     | 100%    | Slightly tougher than PLA |
| PETG     | 235–250°C   | 70–80°C  | 30–50%  | Reduce retraction; sticks aggressively |
| ABS      | 230–250°C   | 100°C    | 0%      | Needs enclosure to avoid warping |
| TPU      | 215–230°C   | 40–60°C  | 50–100% | Print slow (~20–30 mm/s) |
| Nylon    | 240–260°C   | 70–90°C  | 0–30%   | Dry thoroughly before printing |

**Tip:** Always dry hygroscopic filaments (PETG, Nylon, TPU) at recommended temps before printing.

## 4. Printer Calibration

### 4.1 E-steps/mm
1. Mark filament 120 mm above extruder.
2. Command 100 mm extrusion.
3. Measure remaining filament – adjust `M92 E<new_value>`.

### 4.2 Flow Rate Tuning
- Print a single-wall cube.
- Measure wall thickness; adjust flow % to match model wall thickness.

### 4.3 Linear Advance (K-factor)
- Reduces corner blobbing by adjusting extrusion during speed changes.
- Enable in firmware; tune using test patterns.

### 4.4 Bed Tramming & Mesh Leveling
- Manual: Adjust corner screws until paper drags slightly under nozzle.
- Mesh: Use BLTouch/CR Touch to probe multiple points.

## 5. Troubleshooting Guide

**Symptom → Cause → Fix Table:**

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| Stringing | Too high temp; excessive retraction distance | Lower temp, reduce retraction |
| Layer shifting | Loose belts, pulley grub screws, stepper driver overheating | Tighten belts, check pulleys, add cooling |
| Warping | Bed too cold; no enclosure; drafts | Increase bed temp, use brim, add enclosure |
| Z-banding | Inconsistent Z movement | Check leadscrew straightness, lubricate |
| Under-extrusion | Clogged nozzle, low flow rate, filament slip | Clean nozzle, increase flow, check extruder tension |

## 6. Advanced Techniques

### 6.1 Custom G-code Scripts
**Example Start G-code:**
```
G28 ; Home all axes
G92 E0 ; Reset extruder
G1 Z2.0 F3000 ; Move Z up
G1 X0 Y0 F1500 ; Move to corner
M140 S{material_bed_temperature_layer_0} ; Set bed temp
M104 S{material_print_temperature_layer_0} ; Set nozzle temp
```

### 6.2 Multi-Material Printing
- Manual filament swaps via M600 command (requires firmware support).
- Palette/MMU for automatic swaps.

### 6.3 Flexible Filament Printing
- Use direct drive extruder if possible.
- Disable retraction or keep minimal.
- Slow print speed dramatically.

## 7. STL Preparation

### 7.1 Repair Tools
- **Meshmixer** – Inspect, fix holes, reduce triangles.
- **Netfabb** – Automatic repairs.
- **Blender** – Mesh editing, scaling.

### 7.2 Reducing File Size
- Use decimation to reduce triangle count while preserving shape.

## 8. Example Projects

1. **Parametric box with snap-fit lid** – Designed in Fusion 360, tuned tolerances, prints without supports.
2. **Printable camera mount** – Uses PETG for strength, includes articulating joints.

---

## 9. Quick Reference

- PLA prints cool & fast; PETG prints hot & slow.
- Always tune first layer height for adhesion.
- Keep spare nozzles and PTFE tubing.
- Maintain: Lubricate Z-rod, clean bed, check belts.
