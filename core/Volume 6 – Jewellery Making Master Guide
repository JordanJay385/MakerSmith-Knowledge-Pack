# Volume 6 – Jewellery Making Master Guide

This volume covers the art, craft, and technology of jewellery making — from traditional hand fabrication to modern CAD and 3D printing for casting.

---

## 1. Introduction

Jewellery making blends artistry, engineering, and material science. Modern maker culture embraces both traditional bench skills and digital fabrication methods such as 3D printing and CNC milling.

---

## 2. Essential Tools & Workshop Setup

### 2.1 Hand Tools
- Jeweller's saw with blades (sizes 8/0 to 2/0).
- Needle files, flat files, escapement files.
- Pliers: flat nose, round nose, chain nose.
- Hammers: planishing, chasing, rawhide mallet.
- Mandrels for rings and bracelets.

### 2.2 Soldering Setup
- Butane or propane torch with fine tip.
- Soldering block (charcoal, ceramic).
- Pickle pot for cleaning oxides.
- Third hand tool for holding work during soldering.

### 2.3 Safety Equipment
- Safety glasses or magnifying visor.
- Dust mask for sanding and polishing.
- Heat-resistant gloves.

## 3. Materials

### 3.1 Precious Metals
- Gold: 24k (pure), 18k, 14k alloys for hardness.
- Silver: Sterling (92.5% silver) is standard.
- Platinum: Extremely durable, high melting point.

### 3.2 Alternative Metals
- Titanium: Lightweight, strong, hard to work.
- Stainless steel: Affordable, corrosion-resistant.
- Brass & copper: Warm tones, easy to work.

### 3.3 Gemstones
- Precious: Diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald.
- Semi-precious: Amethyst, garnet, topaz.
- Synthetic and lab-grown stones.

### 3.4 Non-Traditional
- Resin, wood, composites, ceramics.

---

## 4. Fabrication Techniques

### 4.1 Sawing & Filing
- Use light pressure, let the blade do the work.
- File edges smooth before joining parts.

### 4.2 Forming
- Use mandrels and mallets for shaping rings and bangles.
- Anneal metal to soften for bending.

### 4.3 Soldering & Annealing
- Use the correct solder (hard, medium, easy) depending on stage.
- Flux to prevent oxidation.

### 4.4 Texturing & Engraving
- Hammer texturing, roll printing, hand engraving.

### 4.5 Stone Setting
- Prong setting: Holds stone with small claws.
- Bezel setting: Metal rim surrounds stone.
- Flush setting: Stone set level with surface.
- Channel setting: Stones set between parallel walls.

### 4.6 Cold Connections
- Riveting, tabs, adhesives for heat-sensitive materials.

## 5. Casting & Moldmaking

### 5.1 Lost Wax Casting
1. Create wax or resin model.
2. Attach sprues and invest in plaster mold.
3. Burnout to remove wax.
4. Pour molten metal via centrifugal or vacuum casting.

### 5.2 Rubber Mold Making
- Vulcanized or cold mold for reproducing models.

---

## 6. Digital Jewellery Design

### 6.1 CAD Software
- RhinoGold, MatrixGold, Blender for jewellery modeling.
- Fusion 360 for precision parametric design.

### 6.2 Workflow
- Create 3D model → Check tolerances → Export STL for printing.

---

## 7. 3D Printing in Jewellery

### 7.1 Printing Masters for Casting
- Use SLA/DLP printers with castable resin.
- Layer height: 25–50 microns for detail.
- Proper curing before burnout.

### 7.2 Cleaning & Post-Processing
- IPA wash, UV cure, inspect for defects.

---

## 8. Finishing & Polishing

### 8.1 Stages
1. Sanding (coarse to fine grit).
2. Buffing with polishing compounds.
3. Ultrasonic cleaning.

### 8.2 Plating
- Gold plating for colour and tarnish resistance.
- Rhodium plating for white gold.

### 8.3 Patinas
- Liver of sulphur for oxidized silver.

---

## 9. Safety & Best Practices
- Ventilate soldering and casting areas.
- Use PPE for chemicals and hot work.
- Keep flammable materials away from open flames.

---

## 10. Example Projects
1. Hand-fabricated sterling silver ring.
2. 3D printed resin master → lost wax cast pendant.
3. Mixed-material brooch combining wood and silver.
