## 1. Introduction to Robotics

Robotics combines mechanical design, electronics, and programming to build systems capable of performing tasks autonomously or via remote control.

**Core Components:**
- Structure/frame
- Actuators (motors, servos)
- Sensors
- Controller (microcontroller/SBC)
- Power system
- Software
